# Homebrew Cask for SherlockEQ.
#
# Lives in a personal tap repo at:
#   github.com/smbrownai/homebrew-sherlockeq/Casks/sherlockeq.rb
#
# Bumping a release:
#   1. dist/release.sh <version>   produces a signed/notarized/stapled dmg
#      and prints the sha256 + the two lines below.
#   2. Copy the printed `version` and `sha256` over the values here.
#   3. Commit and push the tap repo. `brew upgrade --cask sherlockeq`
#      picks it up on the next `brew update`.
#
# Future migration to the official homebrew-cask:
#   - App must be 1.0+ for a stretch, have a real homepage, working
#     livecheck, and not be a beta. The DSL below already passes those.
#   - Submit via `brew bump-cask-pr` once eligible.
